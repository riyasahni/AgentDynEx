# HOW SIMULATION FOLDER WORKS
# each generation rests in generated/generations_[timestamp]_[uuid]
# each generation has a global config.txt and matrix.txt and config_iteration.txt and config_iterations folder
# config_iteration.txt stores the user's current iteration they are working on in the simulation, ie: run-1-1 (we need to parse this)

# IN THE CONFIG ITERATION FOLDER
# navigate the folders by going to: generations_[]_[]/[prototype]/config_iterations/[run-id]/...
# The folder contains
# config_iterations/initial_config.txt - the initially generated config from the design matrix
# config_iterations/run-1 - the folder that stores the information and result of the first run of initial_config.txt
# config_iterations/run-1/initial_config.txt - stores initial_config.txt
# config_iterations/run-1/logs.txt - stores the raw logs from the run
# config_iterations/run-1/results.txt - stores results (like a summary of the logs)
# config_iterations/run-1/improvements.txt - stores improvements
# config_iterations/run-1/updated_config - stores the updated_config based on reflection/improvments
# config_iterations/run-1/run-1-1 - references the first time we run updated_config_run-1
# config_iterations/run-1/run-1-1/initial_config.txt - stores initial_config_run-1.txt from parent folder
# config_iterations/run-1/run-1-1/logs.txt - stores the raw logs from the run
# config_iterations/run-1/run-1-1/results.txt - stores results (like a summary of the logs)
# config_iterations/run-1/run-1-1/improvements.txt - stores improvements
# config_iterations/run-1/run-1-1/updated_config.txt - stores the updated_config based on reflection/improvments
# config_iterations/run-1/run-1-1/run-1-1-1 - references the first time we run updated_config_run-1-1
# config_iterations/run-1/run-1-2 - references the second time we run updated_config_run-1
# config_iterations/run-1/run-1-2/initial_config_run.txt - stores initial_config_run-1.txt from parent folder
# config_iterations/run-1/run-1-2/improvements_run.txt - stores improvements
# config_iterations/run-1/run-1-2/results_run.txt - stores results (like a summary of the logs)
# config_iterations/run-1/run-1-2/updated_config_run.txt - stores the updated_config based on reflection/improvments
# config_iterations/run-1/run-1-2/1-2-1 - references the first time we run updated_config_run-1-1
# config_iterations/run-2 - the folder that stores the information and result of the second run of initial_config.txt
