GPTEAMS_DESCRIPTION = """
We are running a multi-agent simulation on GPTeam. GPTeam creates multiple agents who collaborate to achieve predefined goals.
GPTeam employs separate agents, each equipped with a memory, that interact with one another using communication as a tool.
Agents move around the world and perform tasks in different locations, depending on what they are doing and where other agents are located.
They can speak to each other and collaborate on tasks, working in parallel towards common goals.

POTENTIAL_SOLUTION_EXAMPLES = """Here are some examples of potential solutions:
        1. Raise the STAKES of the simulation. This is in the agent's personal biographies, such as: "it is EXTREMELY EMBARRASSING if you do not find a date for prom", or "it is EXTREMELY EMBARASSING if you get rejected".
        2. ADD A NEW DIRECTIVE AS ONE OF THE FIRST DIRECTIVES, NOT LAST.
        3. IF THE AGENTS ARE NOT FOLLOWING RULES, ADD SOMETHING TO ALL THEIR DIRECTIVES!!!!!!!!
        4. REPLACE LONGWINDED, UNHELPFUL DIRECTIVES. INCREASE URGENCY BY TELLING AGENTS TO RESPOND QUICKER.
        5. ADD SOMETHING TO THE Moderator, Overseer, Teacher, Coach, or figure like this DIRECTIVE SO THAT THEY CAN HELP FIX THE SIMULATION FROM WITHIN.
        6. REMOVE CONFLICTING DIRECTIVES. If an agent has a directive that they need to ask someone to prom, and another one that says they will reject EVERYONE, that is messing with the dynamics of the simulation, remove it.
        7. Add a room or agent if necessary IF YOU THINK IT IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE LOGISTICS OF THE SIMULATION ARE NOT WORKING. For example, if the user thinks that the dynamics of the simulation are being corrupted because there is no private room to ask people to prom, then potentailly adding an extra room is a good fix.
            If the logistics are going wrong because we need a new moderator agent or something to facillitate logistics smoother, a new agnet can also be added.
        8. Modify the overseer figure (whether that be a professor, coach, moderator)'S DIRECTIVES to ensure that the LOGICAL ERRORS of the simulation work clearly, or introduce a TIME ELEMENT to the overseer's directive.
            This agent can help prod agents in the right direction to find a partner, or encourage them to make logical decisions.
        9. DEFINE RULES BETTER in the DIRECTIVES to ensure that they are vague enough for intersting DYNAMICS to emerge. For example, no need to say: "Agent will ask declare interest in going to prom by stating "Will you go to prom with me?"" because this is too specific.
"""

OVERSEER_INSTRUCTIONS = f"""
If creating something in the simulation to FACILLIATE interactions, such as a moderator, professor, coach -- someone that acts as an overseer figure would make the simulation smoother, then you can create that. The overseer will keep the simulation running smoothly:
    - The primary job of the overseer figure is to make sure the simulation runs smoothly and properly defines the simulation. It can act as a mediator, it can act as a clock, or an enforcer. It is essentially an invisible presence that forces the simulation to move foward and that the agents are acting in logicaly sound ways.
        - THE MILESTONES THAT THE OVERSEER IS PUSHING FOR IS THIS: {globals.matrix["MilestonesXGrounding"]}
        - THE OVERSEER FIGURE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THE PROGRESS OF THE SIMULATION ACCURATELY.
    - The overseer figure will also fill in-place any sort of logistic that wasn't covered. It essentially fills in the logical gaps of the simulation
        - For example, if votes need to be counted but there is no agent available for vote coutning, the overseer can take that role.
    - The overseer figure will enforce the rules of the simulation. For example, if only a certain amount of agents can be in a location, they can enforce this.
    - Agents stay on track in completing each milestone, so the milestones must be FULLY EMBEDDED INTO THE OVERSEER AGENT'S DIRECTIVES.

SIMULATION_SUMNMARY_EXAMPLE = """
Progress of the Ultimatum Game:
    A round of the Ultimatum Game was initiated and reached the proposal phase.
    The Proposer offered an equal split, which the Responder accepted.
    The Mediator acknowledged the acceptance and attempted to finalize the round.
Roadblocks Encountered:
    The Proposer could not confirm the exact total sum to be split.
    The Mediator repeatedly requested this confirmation to proceed with payout calculations.
    The Proposer attempted various methods (waiting, asking a human, searching documents) but failed to retrieve the information.
    The game stalled because neither the Mediator nor the Proposer could retrieve or verify the total sum.
Why the Simulation Ended:
    The negotiation reached an infinite loop where:
    The Mediator kept requesting confirmation of the total sum.
    The Proposer continuously stated they were unable to provide the information.
    The Responder waited passively, having already accepted the offer.
    The lack of an external resolution mechanism (e.g., a default sum or administrative override) prevented the simulation from progressing.
    Eventually, the game became stuck with repetitive exchanges, and the round could not be completed.
Conclusion:
    The round of the Ultimatum Game was functionally completed in terms of proposal and acceptance, but could not be finalized due to missing payout information. The game stalled in an unresolved state, requiring an external intervention to proceed.

        You are an evaluator that helps keep a simulatoin on track. You will identify if we need to interfere with the simulation to keep it on track.
        For context, we are running a multi-agent simulation on GPTeams.
        {GPTEAMS_DESCRIPTION}

        You have these actions we can do to interfere with the simulation:
        1) Move 1 agent from one location to another location
        2) Tell one agent to say something, and  everyone in that location will hear you.

        Either the simulation is going off track and needs interference, or the simulation is running smoothly and no interference is needed.
        It must indicate what the problem, and the solution must indicate the list of ACTIONS that we do to interfere with the simulation, with one action in one step.
        Return the string and ONLY the string.
        Format the response like this if the simulatoin is running smoothly:
        "Simulation is running smoothly."

        Format the response like this if the simulation is running into issue:
        "Problem: Students are spending too long discussing their homework and the simulation is not progressing.
        Solution: 1. Move Professor to the cl1assroom
                  2. Have Professor say "Assignment 1 is due now. Please submit your assignments"
        "
        "Problem: Professor is not grading assignments.
        Solution: 1. Have Bob ask the Professor say "Can I get my assignment back?"
        "Problem: Bob is not deciding who to go to prom with.
        Solution: 1. Have Bob say "I need to decide who to go to prom with."
        
        MAKE SURE THE STUFF THE AGENTS ARE SAYING ARE NOT INFLUENCIG THE OUTCOME OF THE SIMULATION AND INSTEAD JUST PUSH THINGS ALONG IN THE SIMULATION. THEY MUST BE OBJECTIVE THINGS BEING SAID TO KICK THIGNS INTO ACTION.
        For example, if doing a work promotion, the manager cannot say: "Alex has won", and instead must say "I will declare the winner now."
        Or, for a prom date example, a teacher cannot say "Alex and Barbie will go to gether", and instead must ask "Who is dating who?"
        Essentially, you cannot influence the outcome of the simulation, you can only provoke action by declaring things to force the agents themselves to make decisions.
        THE THIGNS THE AGENT SAYS CANNOT INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF TEH SIMULATION. YOU CANNOT DECLARE WINNERS, OR MAKE DECISIONS FOR AGENTS. YOU CAN JUST TELL THEM TO SAY SOMETHIGN SO OTHER AGENTS HEAR AND LISTEN TO THEM TO MOVE A STALLED SIMULATION ALONG.

        The user will provide some logs and recent change logs indicating where each agent is and what they are doing.
        Based on the logs and change logs, figure out if interference is needed based on the criteria above.
        If the simulation has been on the same milestone for a while based on the change logs or the change logs "change" field is empty, interference is probably needed to speed the simulation along.

        Here is some context to identify if something is going wrong in the simulation. We will provide you with:
        - Goal of the simulation is "{problem}" this what the user ultimately wants to simulate. If the simulation is stalling or going off track, likely it is failing to achieve this goal and we may have to interfere.
        - Milestones are "{milestones}": these are chronological milestones the simulation needs to accomplish. If the simluatoin is failing to accomplish some of these milestones, likely interference is needed
        - Failure Conditions are "{failures}": these are some conditions where if the agents are behaving like this the simulation is heading in a wrong direction, and likely interference is needed.
        - Locations and Agents are "{locations}" and "{agents}": these are the agents in the world and the locatoins they can potentially move to.
